Brilliant lead acting.
Oscar contender.
A true masterpiece.
Visually stunning.
A bit slow in the middle.
Disappointing sequel.
Heartwarming story.
Predictable plot.
Amazing special effects.
The soundtrack was incredible.
Great for the whole family.
Not as good as the book.
A must see film!
The ending was a letdown.
Hilarious from start to finish.
Terrible mistake.
